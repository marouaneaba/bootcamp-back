# Bistrot API

This CRUD REST API used to expose and manages resources **Lille bistrot**.

**Context:**

We have a menu exposure API that we would like to improve to make it an API that aggregates menus from a bistrot.

Basic restaurant process:

- An owner will create a menu / card from a set of composition, each composition represents a set of the dish or drink.

- A customer can collect all the menu / cards of a bistrot.

- An owner will be able to create, modify and delete a menu, composition and the content of a composition.

## Prerequisites
* JDK 16
* Spring Boot
* Liquibase H2
* Maven (wrapper to simplify ./mvnw)
* Karate
* Add lombok plugin in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ)
* github-action

## Workflow

The workflow for development is based on **github-flow** workflow.
Master or main branch is used for current feature development, branches called **next** are used for next delivery.
**Next** is branch must be stabilized by the development team for delivery.

## Running the project locally
Once everything is set up you can run the project using your favorite IDE or directly with maven.
To start your application , simply run:

    rm -rf data
    ./mvnw clean install && java -jar target/decathlon-bootcamp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 


## Liquibase

The database is generated by liquibase when starting the application.

## H2:

The database is consulted by this console h2
http://localhost:8080/h2-console

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

## kafka

1. Launch Zookeper.
2. Launch kafka.
3. Create topic or use default topic "hello-kafka".

Start zookeeper:
````
apache-zookeeper-3.7.0-bin/bin/zkServer.sh start
````

Start Kafka:
```
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Create topic:
```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create -bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic bootcamp-topic
```

Start producer:
```
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic bootcamp-topic
```

Start consumer:
```
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --from-beginning --topic bootcamp-topic 
```

# Login mock
This app can be used to run as a sidecar during Integartion Tests to mock a Security Provider (like login).

Clone this project: [login-mock](https://github.com/dktunited/login-mock)
Run application:
````
./mvnw clean install && java -jar target/login-mock-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
````

## Generate token

This app has also a controller to generate on demand jwt based on input claims.  
See [TokenRequest](/src/main/java/com/decathlon/member/login/mock/domain/TokenRequest.java) to see all availables params.
In a second step the same runing server can validate the generated token.
You can make a POST on /token uri to obtain the jwt.

* Example for a member token:
``` json
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8082/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"sub": "44bb52d0-ee25-4a1c-9f48-69b0dfcd6eba",
"claims": {
"location": "FR"
},
"scopes": ["profile","openid"]
} 
```
* Example for a client-credential token:
``` json
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8082/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"claims": {
"location": "FR"
},
"scopes": ["ADMIN","PROFILE","TEST"]
} 
```
